# front-end-projects
Small front-end web development projects, comprised of individual components, full web pages, and web applications.

Projects ideas were inspired by Frontend Mentor.
All designs are adapted from [here](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl). 
All code is mine.
